# vsyncer -- verifying and optimizing concurrent code on WMMs

`vsyncer` is a toolkit to verify and optimize concurrent C/C++ programs on Weak
Memory Models (WMMs).  The correctness of the target program is verified with
state-of-the-art model checkers [Dartagnan][] and [GenMC][].  Optimization
of the memory ordering of atomic operations is achieved by speculative
verification of LLVM-IR mutations of the target program with feedback from
the model checkers.  Our ASPLOS'21 [publication][] describes the motivation
and research effort put in this tool.  See references below for further
works using `vsyncer`.

The accompaigning [libvsync][] library contains several practical and efficient
data structures and synchronization primitives verified and optimized with
`vsyncer`.

## Installation

### Precompiled and Docker

The simplest approach to run `vsyncer` is by using the prebuilt binary and
a Docker container with its dependencies.  In more detail:

- download the binary of the current release,
- change the name of the file to `vsyncer`, and then
- either install the file in your `PATH` with `install vsyncer /some/path/bin`,
- or set the file permissions with `chmod 755 vsyncer`.

After that run `vsyncer docker --pull` to fetch the docker container with
the dependencies (GenMC, Dartagnan, clang, etc).

We assume that your user has rights to run docker, ie, either with rootless
Docker or having your user in the `docker` group.  Please read the Docker
[postinstall instructions][] further instructions.

> Note: we have `vsyncer` binaries for macOS and Windows, but they haven't
> been tested thoroughly. Please report any issues.

### Building from source

You will need Golang >= 1.18. Clone this repository and then run

    make install PREFIX=/path/to/bin

By default, `vsyncer` uses the runtime dependencies from the Docker image
`ghcr.io/open-s4c/vsyncer` with tag `latest`. In contrast, precompiled
releases use the fixed tag of the release.

To select a specific Docker image tag set `DOCKER_TAG` when installing
`vsyncer`:

    make install PREFIX=/path/to/bin DOCKER_TAG=latest

### Disabling Docker

To run `vsyncer` without Docker, you'll need the following tools:

- clang and llvm >= v14
- Dartagnan >= v4.0.1 (alternative)
- GenMC >= v0.9 (alternative)

When installing `vsyncer` from source, set `USE_DOCKER=false` so that
the binary does not try to use Docker but instead call the tools as
normal programs in the host:

    make install PREFIX=/path/to/bin USE_DOCKER=false

We assume these tools are in `PATH`, but you can ajust that with the
environment variables `DARTAGNAN_JAVA_CMD`, `GENMC_CMD` and `CLANG_CMD`.
See `vsyncer -h` for more information about the configuration via
environment variables.

## Overview

The `vsyncer` program offers several commands to manipulate and inspect
concurrent programs.  Central to `vsyncer` is the concept of **atomic
operations**, which encompass atomic memory operations such as atomic
reads, atomic writes, and read-modify-write operations as well as memory
fences. Every atomic operation has a **memory ordering** (called [barrier
mode][publication]). The memory ordering speficies how an atomic operation is
ordered in relation to other concurrent operations in the program.  `vsyncer`
supports four memory orderings: `SeqCst`, `Release`, `Acquire`, and `Relaxed`.

The input of `vsyncer` is an LLVM-IR module of compiled C/C++ userspace
program. If the program is not yet compiled, `vsyncer` calls `clang`
underneath to generate the `.ll` file.

Given a module, `vsyncer` statically analyzes its callgraph starting from the
`main()` function and keeps track of all operations that may be executed
in runtime.  A **selection** is the sequence of tracked operations in one
of the following kinds:

- *L*: all read operations (atomic and plain)
- *S*: all write operations (atomic and plain)
- *A*: all atomic operations
- *X*: the read-modify-write subset of atomic operations
- *F*: the memory fence subset of atomic operations

`vsyncer` is able to mainly perform two kinds of **mutations** (ie, program
transformations): (1) with *A*, *X*, and/or *F* selections, `vsyncer`
can modify the memory ordering of atomic operations, making them weaker
or stronger; or (2) with *L* or *S* selections, it can transform plain
operations (ie, ordinary non-atomic reads and writes) into atomic operations
and vice-versa.

An **assignment** is a selection of operations and a sequence
of values representing the operations' memory orderings or their plain/atomic
modifier (depending on the selection type).  The sequence of values is encoded
as a **bitsequence**  such as `0b001101` or `0x1a40`.

*L* and *S* assignments take bitsequences in which each bit represents whether a specific read or write operation is an atomic or plain operation.
*A*, *X*, and *F* assignments take bitsequences in which each **pair** of bits represent the memory ordering of a specific atomic operation.
The memory may be relaxed (`0b00`),  release (`0b01`), acquire (`0b10`), or sequentially consistent (`0b11`).

## Quick start

### Retrieving information from program

    vsyncer info example/ttaslock.c

### Checking whether program is correct

    vsyncer check example/ttaslock.c

### Mutating program with a memory ordering assignment:

    vsyncer mutate -o ttaslock.ll example/ttaslock.c -A 0x123
    vsyncer info ttaslock.ll

To make all memory orderings be sequential consistent, you have to set all
the bits of the bitsequences. Since this is used quite often, `vsyncer`
accepts -1 as a shortcut for a bitsequence with all bits set.

### Checking mutation

    vsyncer check ttaslock.ll

Or simply mutate and check in a single command:

    vsyncer check -A 0x123 example/ttaslock.c

Finally, to optimize the barriers, use `vsyncer optimize`. We suggest mutating
the program to have all atomic operations with sequential consistent memory
ordering first.

    vsyncer optimize -A -1 example/ttaslock.c

## Limitations

### Function pointers

Function pointers are not analyzed. The model checker still should guarantee
the correctness of the given program with function pointers, however, the
optimization does not consider them.  If a function (passed as pointer)
uses **too weak** memory orderings, `vsyncer optimize` won't be able to
fix the missing barriers, but the model checker should still report errors
if correctness is affected.  If a function (passed as pointer) user **too
strong** memory orderings, `vsyncer optimize` won't be able to optimize the
memory orderings, but the code will still be correct.
